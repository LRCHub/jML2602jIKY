# VivaOla – Grown Too Old

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Just let me dream one last time
Never got it right
(After sleepless nights)
All I fear is your silence
You say nothing when we fight
Words are dressed in white
(Over time, over love, over my skin)
Don't wanna stay and waste away my precious time
Memories turned to chains, still left behind
終わりにしよう
もう悩みたくない
だって明日はきっと晴れ
Stop dreaming, time to let me go
So goodbye
The weight's lifted, I carried you too long
We've grown too old
(Just like 2020,summer still smells like you)
また笑って誤魔化さないで
分かったようなフリ
もう二度としないで
After all this time, why can't you see?
You do you, I'll let you be
(I don't think you'd understand)
Don't wanna stay and waste away my precious time
Memories turned to chains, still left behind
Stop dreaming, time to let me go
So goodbye
The weight's lifted, I carried you too long
We've grown too old
I thought we'd make it, here we are
You said "forever", now we are
I dreamt someday we'd leave this town
I used to dream of-
Dream of you and-
Maybe it's time
Stop dreaming, time to let me go
So goodbye
The weight's lifted, I carried you too long
We've grown too old
Stop dreaming, time to let me go
So goodbye
The weight's lifted, I carried you too long
We've grown too old
Your playlist still plays in my car
These songs remember who we were
I saw you, thought I might say hi
But I just kept driving, let it slide on by
